# cardgames-webapp

## About this Project
This project uses Vue.js to run a simple card game. It makes calls to https://deckofcardsapi.com for the card fronts and backs. Right now the only game running is a simple matching game, but in the future I plan to connect this web page to a back-end server utilizing the logic of my [CardgamesV3](https://github.com/seth-aker/Cardgames_v3) project. Go ahead and try it out to see what you think!

### Still a WIP
Thank you for checking out my work! I currently do not have a real domain set up for this webpage, so in order to view it follow the steps below on a text editor of your choice with npm installed. I have yet to adjust the visuals for mobile.


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
